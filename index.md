**Git** is a [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) for tracking changes to projects, usually for co-ordinating work among programmers collabratively developing source code during software development.

## **Why Git is needed?**
Git is needed to ensure that there are no code conflicts between the developers when multiple developers are working on a same project parallel.
It also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

## **Features of Git**

+ Distributed System.
+ Compatible with all the Operating Systems.
+ Git allows its users to work on a line that runs parallel to the main project files.
+ Users are allowed from all over the world to perform operations on a project remotely.
+ It is free and open source version control system.

  + **_git clone [url]_**            - obtain a repository from an existing URL.
  + **_git add [file]_**             - adds a file to the staging area.
  + **_git commit_**                 - Record changes to the repository 
  + **_git diff_**                   - shows the file differences which are not yet staged.

**GitHub** is a _Git repository hosting service_. 
 It is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.
 While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface.

|**Git**|**GitHub**|
| :----------------------------------------------------------|:------------:| 
|Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history| GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories | 
|Git is focused on version control and code sharing| GitHub is focused on centralized source code hosting|
|Installed locally| Hosted in cloud|
|No user management features| Built-in user management features|
|Primarily a command line tool| Administered through web|


## **Open source contribution** 

 Open source refers to source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a permissive license.
 If you are interested to improve the tools you use every day, you can submit contributions to their open source projects.
 In addition, contributing to open source allows you to improve your coding skills.
